Function:
Convert one or multiple .html files to Base64 Data URIs. There are tools available online 
that perform the same action but this tool is faster for converting multiple files. 

Instructions:
Save the Base64Convert.html file or copy it to your own HTML document.

Open the file to edit it.

Edit the pn variable at the very beginning of the opening script tag to set your project name.

Save the changes.

Launch the file in your browser.

Click Choose Files.

Select the all the files to convert.

Click Open after all files are selected.

Set the save location.

Leave the name as is.

Click Save at the prompt for each file. (annoying but goes fast.)

All files should now be saved in the specified location converted to Base64.

Some minters/minting platforms will require Base64 content as string which is what this tool does. If that's all you need you're good to go. If you're required to JSON format your Base64 content with quotes and commas you can use this FormatBase64 tool https://github.com/TheRefreshCNFT/Tools/tree/master/Powershell/FormatBase64.
