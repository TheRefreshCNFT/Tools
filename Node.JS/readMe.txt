Function:
Minify all .html files in the specified directory, can be one or multiple files. There are tools available online that perform 
the same action but this is faster for multiple files. 


Instructions:
Save the file or copy the text to your own .ps1 file.

Open the file to edit it.

Set the source directory where it says "Path to source directory goes here." The "" are needed, add the path between them. 

Set the output directory to the source directory to overwrite the HTML files or to a new directory to keep originals the same. Add the output path 
the same way between the "".

Add or remove any parameters needed.

Save changes.

Right click the MinifyHTML.ps1 file select Run with Powershell.

Minified files should be in the output directory now.
