I used these scripts to help create the 4Fre5h.

I needed 622 with only 1 design, 466 with 2 designs, 312 with 3 designs, and 155 random with all the designs.

I created a template file for each category.

I created a .ps1 for each category.

I created an output folder for each category.

Upaded the scripts as needed for template file names, output folders, and count.

Ran the scripts and had 1555 updated html files in just a few mintues.
