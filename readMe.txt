This is a library of tools that can be used to help create NFT projects that are done in code. 
The tools can be used for onchain and IPFS code based mints. These tools will be improved and new ones will be added over time.


Example of how to use these tools:
1. Download or make a copy of the HTML template.
2. Build out your project template .html file.
3. Make note of the variables you want to randomize.
4. Download or make a copy of the Powershell UpdateVariable script that suits your needs.
5. Use the UpdateVariable script to create all the different versions for the project.
6. Download or make a copy of the MinifyHTML scripts.
7. Use the MinifyHTML script to minify all the .html files output by the Powershell UpdateVariable script.
8. Download or make a copy of the Base64Convert tool.
